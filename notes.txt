To rename a file in the repository:
git mv filename new_filename

To delete a file:
git rm <file>

If you deleted a file locally, to delete it remotely:

commit the deletion:
git commit -a -m "A file was deleted"

And push your commit upstream:
git push origin master
___________________________________________

To push a file edit to remote:

change a file and add it to the  Git staging area: (This area contains a list of all the files you have recently changed. Your repository will be updated the next time you create a commit with your changes)
git add notes.txt

You can check which files are being tracked with"
git status

Now that git tracks the file, we can commit:
git commit -m "file changing message"

Commit simply creates a checkpoint that you can revert to at any time. Now we can push to GitHub:
git push origin master
